# React-TypeScript-Simple-List-Example: 
## A Basic [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and Experimental [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) Demo

- This is a very basic simple list TypeScript/React example using Chakra UI as the basis for a design system. It is currently in what one might call a demo-able mvp, but not production ready quality state (more refinement of non-generic styling needed). 
- Included is the official Chakra UI Storybook module (which appears to need its own refinement as well for some component stories).

### Running
- `yarn run storybook`
  - **Note:** This uses yarn 4.0+, which supports zero-installs. So with the defined yarn version or newer installed on your machine, this should run without an install of the package dependencies. Barring this, see [yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install) for installing packages if cache is not picked up. 

## TODO
- [ ] add screenshot(s), gif demo(s)
- [ ] refine list and theme default styling
- [ ] enable extensible dynamic props based list styling for use within a hypothetical 'organzational ready' design system.
